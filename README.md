# Crossy Road
This is a games that emulates the basic mechanics of the popular game Crossy Road. It is written in JavasCript using the library P5.js
## Functionality
It works like this: you (the circle) goes up, down left or right if you push the arrows and it can go there. If you get behind the map, you lose.
## How to run
  * Download the file 
  * Extract it anywhere
  * Open the index.html
  * You should see the game running!
## Video Example

## Future improvements
I would like that some objects are able move (like the cars in crossy road) and that colliding with a category 2 object kills you, ending the run. Also, a better map generator that takes into account the previous blocks is a necessary improvement.
